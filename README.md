## Data description

### amip-piForcing

AGCM forced with monthly varying AMIP II SST and sea-ice boundary conditions.

### hadSST-piForcing

As `amip-piForcing` but using HadISST1 SST boundary conditions instead (sea-ice remains as per AMIP II)

### abrupt-4xCO2

`abrupt-4xCO2` simulations with AGCMs parent AOGCM.
